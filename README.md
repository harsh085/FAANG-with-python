# FAANG-with-python

# 🔶 Stage 1: Python Core & Data Structures

## 📌 Goals

- **Build intuition** on how Python handles memory and data structures under the hood.
- **Understand time and space complexity** of built-in operations.

---

## ✅ To-Do

1. **Master Built-in Types**
   - `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `dict`, `str`
   - Learn operations: slicing, searching, insertion, deletion, sorting

2. **Understand Complexity**
   - Time/space for:
     - `list.append()`, `list.insert()`, `dict.get()`, `set.add()`, etc.
   - Use: Big-O cheat sheet

3. **Dive into `collections` Module**
   - Learn: `defaultdict`, `Counter`, `OrderedDict`, `deque`, `namedtuple`

4. **Useful Standard Libraries**
   - `itertools`, `heapq`, `bisect`, `functools`, `math`, `operator`

---

## Key Concepts

### Asymptotic Notations & Amortized Analysis

- **Master the Big O notation** for common operations.
- **Amortized analysis**: Understand how average performance can differ from worst-case.

---

## Mutable and Non-Mutable Types

- Know which types are mutable (`list`, `dict`, `set`, `deque`) and which are immutable (`tuple`, `str`, `namedtuple`).

---

##  Lists (Dynamic Arrays)

- **Stores references**, not objects – supports heterogeneous types
- **Use case:** Best for random access and growing lists



---

## Tuples (Immutable Sequences)

- **Immutable sequences** with O(1) access time
- **Memory efficient** compared to lists for fixed data
- **Access by index**: O(1) – like lists, stored in contiguous memory

---

## Dictionaries (Hash Maps)

- **Get/Set operations:** O(1) average case, O(n) worst case
- **Understanding hash collision handling** is crucial

---

## Sets

- **Add/Remove/Contains:** O(1) average case
- **Set operations** (union, intersection): O(len(s1) + len(s2))
- **Essential for** deduplication and membership testing

---

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

- **Master Big O notation** for common operations.
- **Scalability intuition:**
  - For lists with 1,000× more data:
    - O(1): no change
    - O(log n): ~10× slowdown
    - O(n): 1,000× slowdown
    - O(n²): 1,000,000× slowdown

---

## Collections Module Mastery

The `collections` module provides specialized container datatypes that are frequently tested in interviews:

### Counter

- Counting hashable objects with O(n) time complexity for creation
- Most common operations and arithmetic operations on counts

### deque (Double-ended queue)

- O(1) append/pop from both ends vs O(n) for list operations at the beginning
- Essential for BFS implementations and sliding window problems

### defaultdict

- Eliminates KeyError exceptions and reduces code complexity
- Particularly useful for grouping and counting problems

### namedtuple

- Provides readable, immutable data structures
- Memory efficient alternative to classes for simple data containers

### OrderedDict and ChainMap

- `OrderedDict` maintains insertion order (less relevant since Python 3.7)
- `ChainMap` creates a single view of multiple mappings
